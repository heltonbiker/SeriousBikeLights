We have a finite number of pins for each use in the Arduino UNO, and so we need to have a strategy to choose the most important pin types first.

Then, it is important to determine HOW MUCH OF EACH type our application is going to need. 

So here are the most important types of each use, and the CANDIDATES uses for each:

  - Interrupts:
    - Speed meter (from hub generator);
  - I2C
    - Display OLED
  - PWM
    - Headlight
    - Left Turn
    - Right Turn
    - Red Tail Left
    - Red Tail Right
  - Analog in
    - Light sensor
    - Battery sensor
  - Digital Out
  - Digital In
